## App Description

Having trouble calculating the tip amount? At a new state unaware of the tipping norm? This tip calculator is perfect for you- 

Type in the bill amount, select the desired tip percentage (15%, 18%, 20%), and we will tell you the **total amount with tip included**. 

Simply navigate to 'Tip Help' and select the state, 
to find out information about the **average tip rate** and the **minimum wage** at the selected state. 
(This feature is not yet supported. The app currently has an example for the state of Indiana.)

- [x] Enabled navigating between screens. 
- [x] Added 'Tip Help' screen, which provides users simple context about the selected state.  

## Notes

I am hoping this app can especially be helpful for those who is unfamiliar with the tipping culture or the tipping amount. I implemented the basic idea for the 'Tip Help' section, and I look forward to fully implementing it when I learn more features of Swift/Xcode in the Spring. I also based my app's color code on CodePaths's signature green:). Thank you for the opportunity to apply for Tech Fellows and to learn the basics of Swift, and thank you for your consideration. My co-tech fellow applicant Eliza and I are already excited about diving deeper into the iSO development after creating just this simple app.
